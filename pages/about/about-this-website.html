      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The CA.gov portal first launched in 1996 when Governor Pete Wilson was
        in office. It contained information about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Governor</li>
        <li>History, culture, economy</li>
        <li>Doing business in California</li>
        <li>Government officials and agencies</li>
        <li>Disaster preparedness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It started as an initiative in 1995. The State Librarian and the
        California State Home Team created the original site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the website grew and contained more information, including
        links to public services.
