        Here’s what you need to know before you return to your home.
      </p>
      <h2 class="m-t-0">Timeline for returning to your home</h2>
      <p>
        Local, state, and federal response teams are assessing neighborhoods.
        This includes removing highly toxic and explosive materials and
        environmental hazards that are dangerous to returning residents. This
        important work takes time. Teams are working around the clock to make
        sure it’s safe for you and your family to return.
      </p>

      <h2>Returning to your neighborhood</h2>
      <p>
        First responders continually assess if an area is okay for residents to
        enter. Los Angeles County publishes this on their
        <a href="https://lacounty.gov/emergency/">Emergency page</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Insurance assessments</h2>
      <p>
        Insurance assessments can start now. Most major insurers honor damage
        assessments by local, state, and federal inspection teams. Ask your
        insurance company if they accept government inspections for a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fire damage map for your area will tell you if inspectors have
        visited your property:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://arcg.is/1vnjra1">Palisades Fire damage map</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://arcg.is/nqWXD0">Eaton Fire damage map</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>An icon will let you know the status of your property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No Damage</li>
        <li>Minor Damage</li>
        <li>Greater than 50% damage</li>
        <li>Destroyed</li>
        <li>No icon means inspectors have not yet assessed your property</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There will be a photo of your property. You can share this with your
        insurance company.
      </p>

      <h2>Cleanup timeline</h2>

      <p>Cleanup is underway. There are 2 phases.</p>

      <p>
        Phase 1 is automatic and at no cost to the property owner. It includes
        all residential properties destroyed by the fires. Hazmat experts from
        the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are inspecting properties. They
        are removing toxic and explosive materials. This makes sure there are no
        deadly threats to human health, animals, and the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Phase 1, Phase 2 starts. Property owners will get a choice of
        cleanup options.
      </p>

      <h2>Debris clearing timeline</h2>

      <p>
        Several factors determine when debris is cleared from your lot. The
        local government sets priorities. For example, they could focus on
        properties near:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Public facilities</li>
        <li>Schools</li>
        <li>Parks</li>
        <li>Nursing homes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Local government also prioritizes areas that are a threat to the
        environment. This includes areas near creeks and other bodies of water.
      </p>

      <p>
        The State will schedule properties in groups as much as possible. This
        will maximize efficiency and productivity. Their goal is to restore
        communities as fast as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Household hazardous waste</h2>

      <p>
        Household hazardous waste is explosive or highly toxic chemicals
        sometimes found in homes. It is a threat to public health, animals, or
        the environment. Examples include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pool chemicals</li>
        <li>Car batteries</li>
        <li>Antifreeze</li>
        <li>Used oil filters</li>
        <li>Solvents</li>
        <li>Fertilizers</li>
        <li>Pesticides</li>
        <li>Propane tanks</li>
        <li>Disinfectants</li>
        <li>Aerosols</li>
        <li>Paint</li>
        <li>Bleach</li>
        <li>Ammunition</li>
      </ul>
