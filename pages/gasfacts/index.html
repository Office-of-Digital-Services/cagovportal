                California’s state taxes and fees don’t change day-to-day. Oil
                industry profits and costs do. The oil industry drives
                fluctuations in gas prices, including price spikes. Californians
                paid a record $2.61 more per gallon than the national average in
                2022. Yet state taxes and fees stayed the same.

                  Have you heard of our state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard? It’s a
                  unique tool that cuts pollution and saves drivers at the pump.

                        The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) was established by
                        Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007 to diversify and
                        expand California’s transportation fuel supply,
                        decarbonize our transportation sector and improve air

                        It sets a declining carbon-intensity target for
                        California’s transportation fuels. Fuel producers can
                        choose to comply by:

                      <ol>
                        <li>Meeting that target, </li>
                        <li>
                          Exceeding the target and earning “credits” for doing
                          so, which they can bank for the future or sell to
                          other producers who have not met the target, or
                        </li>

                          Buying credits from other producers to make up for any

                        And alternative fuels are getting cheaper, thanks to
                        LCFS. Renewable diesel, which was once more expensive
                        than traditional fossil diesel, is now getting more
                        competitive in price with its petroleum counterpart​.
                        Today, zero-emission vehicles are more affordable and
                        increasingly common on California’s roads. This shift is
                        a direct result of the LCFS creating a market where
                        cleaner fuels can thrive, driving down costs and
                        providing more options for consumers.

                      Does LCFS contribute to gasoline price spikes?

                        No. In fact, more production of cleaner fuels means less
                        dependence on foreign oil, which helps shield
                        Californians from spikes in gas prices. And LCFS has
                        displaced more than 30 billion gallons of petroleum fuel
                        since [2011?].

                        State agencies examined data on retail gasoline prices
                        between 2019 and 2023. The LCFS and other environmental
                        programs contributed to roughly 6% of the increase in
                        retail gasoline prices during this time period. Federal,
                        state and local taxes and fees accounted for 12%.

                        80% of the increase in retail gasoline prices during
                        this time period went to oil companies.

                        State fees, taxes and environmental programs paid by
                        gasoline consumers are re-invested in California and
                        deliver benefits such as improved air quality, safer
                        roads and improvements to public transit. This cannot be
                        said for the other costs embedded in retail gasoline
                        prices that consumers pay per gallon of gasoline.

                        Big polluters and their allies have spent millions of
                        dollars to push a false narrative about California’s gas
                        prices. Why? Simply put, they’re placing profits ahead
                        of the needs of California consumers – allowing gas
                        prices to spike by keeping supplies artificially low and
                        reaping billions of dollars in doing so.

                        The Air Resources Board directed staff to assess any
                        impacts of the recently adopted policy on retail

                With new tools, the state is closely tracking gas prices. We
                look at several factors, including gas supply and refinery
                maintenance.

                California has also proposed a first-in-the-nation rule for
                refineries. It would require them to maintain a minimum
                inventory of fuel. They would have to responsibly plan for
                interruptions due to maintenance. This would prevent price
                spikes from artificially low supply when demand is high.
                Californians could save hundreds of millions, if not billions,
                of dollars.
