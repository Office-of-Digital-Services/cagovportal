      <h2>Timeline for returning home</h2>
      <p>
        Local, state, and federal teams are assessing neighborhoods. This
        includes removing highly toxic and explosive materials and environmental
        hazards. This important work takes time. Teams are working around the
        clock to make sure it’s safe for you to return.
      </p>

      <h2>Returning to your neighborhood</h2>
      <p>
        You are not allowed to enter your neighborhood if it’s in an evacuation
        order area. First responders check daily that an area is okay for people
        to enter. Some areas are clear for re-entry for residents. Los Angeles
        County publishes this on their
        <a href="https://lacounty.gov/emergency/">Emergency page</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Insurance assessments</h2>
      <p>
        Insurance assessments can start now. Most major insurers honor damage
        assessments by local, state, and federal inspection teams. Ask your
        insurance company if they accept government inspections for a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fire damage map for your area will tell you if inspectors have
        visited your property.
      </p>

      <p>An icon will let you know the status of your property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No Damage</li>
        <li>Minor Damage</li>
        <li>Greater than 50% damage</li>
        <li>Destroyed</li>
        <li>No icon means inspectors have not yet assessed your property</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There will be a photo of your property. You can share this with your
        insurance company.
      </p>

      <h2>Cleanup timeline</h2>

      <p>Cleanup is underway. There are 2 phases.</p>

      <p>
        Phase 1 is automatic and at no cost to the property owner. It includes
        all residential properties destroyed by the fires. Hazmat experts from
        the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are inspecting properties. They
        are also removing toxic and explosive materials or making them safe.
        This makes sure there are no deadly threats to human health, animals,
        and the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Phase 1, Phase 2 starts. Property owners will get a choice of
        cleanup options.
      </p>

      <h2>Debris clearing timeline</h2>

      <p>
        Several factors determine when debris is cleared from your lot. The
        local government sets priorities. For example, they could focus on
        properties near:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Public facilities</li>
        <li>Schools</li>
        <li>Parks</li>
        <li>Nursing homes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Local government also prioritizes areas that are a threat to the
        environment. This includes areas near creeks and other bodies of water.
      </p>

      <p>
        The state will schedule properties in groups as much as possible. This
        will maximize efficiency and productivity. Their goal is to restore
        communities as fast as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Household hazardous waste</h2>

      <p>
        Household hazardous waste is explosive or highly toxic chemicals
        sometimes found in homes. It is a threat to public health, animals, or
        the environment. Examples include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pool chemicals</li>
        <li>Car batteries</li>
        <li>Antifreeze</li>
        <li>Used oil filters</li>
        <li>Solvents</li>
        <li>Fertilizers</li>
        <li>Pesticides</li>
        <li>Propane tanks</li>
        <li>Disinfectants</li>
        <li>Aerosols</li>
        <li>Paint</li>
        <li>Bleach</li>
        <li>Ammunition</li>
      </ul>
