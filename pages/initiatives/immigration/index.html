          California is home to many families with different immigration
          statuses. Many US citizens live with family members in “mixed-status”
          families who
        </p>

        <ul class="lead">
          <li>have a green card or a visa but aren’t US citizens, or</li>
          <li>who are undocumented.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Californians may have questions about public programs, their families'
          mixed immigration status, or what federal immigration policies mean
          for their daily lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          These resources can help answer those questions. The resources are for
          families and groups that engage immigrant families, such as schools,
          local governments, and community organizations. For local government
          entities seeking technical assistance, including how changing
          immigration rules affect Californians’ eligibility for public
          programs, you may reach out to the state’s Council on immigration
          issues at
          <a href="mailto:immigrantintegration.initiatives@gobiz.ca.gov"

        <h2 class="mt-0">Who are immigrant families in California?</h2>
        <p>
          Millions of Californians live in families with immigrant family
          members. Immigrant Californians:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Are documented.</span>
            Over half are US citizens. Others have a different documented status
            from the U.S. government, like a green card, a work visa, and some
            have temporary protections like TPS (Temporary Protected Status) and
            DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). California is also
            home to refugees and vulnerable populations in the U.S. for
            humanitarian reasons. The federal administration has taken actions
            to start revoking some immigrants’ temporary legal status,
            facilitating more deportations, and increasing scrutiny within the
            immigration legal process. Families with questions should consult a
            qualified lawyer for advice. There are resources below about legal
            services and how to avoid fraud.
          </li>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Have kids.</span> About half of all kids in
            California have at least one immigrant parent. One in five (20%)
            California children live in mixed-status families. Mixed-status
            families are families whose members have different citizenship or
            immigration status, like a US citizen child with an undocumented
            grandparent or a mom who has a green card (lawful permanent
            resident). The well-being of children has been impacted by escalated
            immigration enforcement. The resources listed below can help
            families.
          </li>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Are business owners or workers.</span> Immigrants
            are 38.6 % of entrepreneurs, 39.4 % of STEM workers, and 35.0 % of
            nurses in the state. Many immigrants work in agriculture,
            manufacturing, construction and general services industries. Many
            businesses and immigrants in key sectors are affected by the change
            in federal immigration policies, which also affects the economy. The
            resources listed below provide information for businesses and
            workers.
          </li>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Contribute to the economy:</span> In 2021,
            immigrants contributed $51.4 billion to California's state and local
            taxes and $81.8 billion to federal taxes and had $354 billion in
            spending power. The Bay Area Council found that mass deportations in
            California could result in a $275 billion loss to the state’s
            economy and a $23 billion reduction in annual tax revenue. The loss
            of immigrant labor would delay projects (including rebuilding Los
            Angeles after the wildfires), reduce food supply, and drive up
            costs.

            Information for Californians related to Immigration Enforcement
          </h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="m-t-md">
        Trump’s militarization of Los Angeles has also led to increasingly
        concerning tactics by federal immigration enforcement, including
        violating the law and people’s constitutional rights to meet the federal
        government’s goals to detain and deport as many people as possible..
        That’s why it’s important to remember the following if you are affected
        by a federal immigration action:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="m-t">
          You can observe and record public immigration arrests, but stay calm
          and at a safe distance to avoid risk to yourself and others.
        </li>
        <li class="m-t">
          Do not interfere or argue with federal agents. Physical obstruction or
          verbal escalation can put your safety at risk and may lead to criminal
          charges.
        </li>
        <li class="m-t">
          Agents don’t need a judge-signed warrant to arrest someone in public —
          but do need one to enter non-public areas of private property.
        </li>
        <li class="m-t">
          Prepare yourself and your family in case you are arrested. Memorize
          the phone numbers of your family members and your lawyer. Make
          emergency plans if you have children or take medication.
        </li>
        <li class="m-t">
          Even if you believe your rights are being violated, don’t argue,
          resist or obstruct the officer. You can verbally assert your rights in
          a calm and clear manner.
        </li>
        <li class="m-t">
          Violence is never the answer, and assaulting a federal agent or
          obstructing an arrest is a crime.
        </li>
        <li class="m-t">
          If you believe your rights were violated, you may contact qualified
          legal counsel and organizations such as the ACLU.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Homeland Security rescinded the Sensitive Areas memo, schools are no
          longer out of reach for immigration enforcement activities. California
          schools still promote safe school environments and follow model
          policies, as dictated by AB 699 (2017). The Governor recently signed
          legislation that establishes baseline expectations to keep people
          safe, laying out that:
          <ul>
            <li class="m-t">
              Families should be notified when immigration enforcement comes on
              school campuses, and establish that student information and
              classrooms are protected from ICE — and require a judicial warrant
              or court order to be accessed.
            </li>
            <li class="m-t">
              Emergency rooms and other nonpublic areas in a hospital are off
              limits to immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant or
              court order, and it clarifies that immigration information
              collected by a health care provider is protected as medical
              information.
            </li>
            <li class="m-t">
              Law and immigrant enforcement officers must be identifiable by
              name or badge number, and exceptions to that must be clearly
              established — masks are not to be worn except when absolutely
              necessary.
            </li>
            <li class="m-t">Impersonating a federal agent is a crime.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In 2024, Governor Newsom sent a letter to school leaders affirming
        California’s commitment to a safe environment for all students,
        including immigrant students and students from immigrant families.

        Also in 2024, Attorney General Bonta issued updated guidance and model
        policies to assist California’s K-12 schools and higher education
        institutions in responding to immigration issues:

      <h4 class="h3">Confidentiality of student information</h4>
      <p>
        Schools must protect the privacy of their students. Schools are
        prohibited from sharing personal information about students or their
        family members for immigration-enforcement purposes. Immigration
        authorities must have a court order or judicial subpoena to receive
        information.
