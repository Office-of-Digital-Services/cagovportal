          California is home to many families with different immigration
          statuses. Many US citizens live with family members who
        </p>

        <ul class="lead">
          <li>have a green card or a visa but aren’t US citizens, or</li>
          <li>who are undocumented.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Californians may have questions about public programs, their families'
          mixed immigration status, or what federal immigration policies mean
          for their daily lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          These resources can help answer those questions. The resources are for
          families and groups that engage immigrant families, such as schools,
          local governments, and community organizations. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We will continue to update these resources so they stay relevant and
          useful. The updates will also reflect changes in federal policy.

        <p>
          Millions of Californians live in families with immigrant family
          members. Immigrant Californians:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Are documented.</span>
            Over half are US citizens. Others have a different documented status
            from the U.S. government, like a green card, a work visa, and some
            have temporary protections like TPS (Temporary Protected Status) and
            DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). California is also
            home to refugees and vulnerable populations in the U.S. for
            humanitarian reasons.
          </li>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Have kids.</span> About half of all kids in
            California have at least one immigrant parent. One in five (20%)
            California children live in mixed-status families. Mixed-status
            families are families whose members have different citizenship or
            immigration status, like a US citizen child with an undocumented
            grandparent or a mom who has a green card (lawful permanent
            resident).
          </li>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Are business owners or workers.</span> Immigrants
            are 38.6 % of entrepreneurs, 39.4 % of STEM workers, and 35.0 % of
            nurses in the state. Many immigrants work in agriculture,
            manufacturing, construction and general services industries.
          </li>
          <li class="m-t">
            <span class="bold">Contribute to the economy:</span> In 2021,
            immigrants contributed $51.4 billion to California's state and local
            taxes and $81.8 billion to federal taxes and had $354 billion in
            spending power.

      <p>
        All students, including those who are undocumented or come from
        immigrant families, have the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="m-t">attend public school</li>
        <li class="m-t">participate in school activities</li>

          <span class="bold">Immigration enforcement officers: </span> Schools
          are generally prohibited from voluntarily granting immigration
          enforcement officers access to campus. They need a judicial warrant or
          court order.

        <li class="m-t">

        In 2024, Governor Newsom sent a letter to school leaders affirming

        including immigrant students and students from immigrant families.

      <h4 class="h3">Confidentiality of student information</h4>
      <p>
        Schools must protect the privacy of their students. Schools are
        prohibited from sharing personal information about students or their
        family members for immigration-enforcement purposes. Immigration
        authorities must have a court order or judicial subpoena to receive
        information.
