  The California Department of Technology (CDT) is established by Government
  Code sections 11545-11548. CDT is committed to promoting and protecting the
  privacy rights of individuals, as enumerated in Article 1 of the California
  Constitution and other Laws. It is the policy of CDT to limit the collection
  and safeguard the privacy of Personal Information and Electronically Collected
  Personal Information (as defined below) that is collected or maintained by
  CDT.
</p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy only applies to the CDT.ca.gov and CA.gov website run by
  the CDT.
</p>

<h2>Applicable Laws</h2>

<p>
  CDT’s information management practices conform to the requirements of the
  Information Practices Act (Civ. Code, §§1798 et seq.), the Public Records Act
  (Govt. Code, §§7920.000 et seq.), Government Code sections 11015.5 and
  11019.9, and other applicable state and federal laws (e.g., Federal Privacy
  Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a)) pertaining to information privacy (Laws).
</p>

<p>
  If any type of Personal Information or Electronically Collected Personal
  Information (as defined below) is requested on the website or volunteered by
  the users, then this information will be governed by Laws. This information
  may become a public record once it is provided. Additionally, except for
  Electronically Collected Personal Information, Personal Information may be
  subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal
  or state law.
</p>

<h2>
  Definitions of Personal Information and Electronically Collected Personal
  Information
</h2>
<p>
  <strong>“Personal Information”</strong> means any information that is
  maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual, including,
  but not limited to, the individual’s name, social security number, physical
  description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial
  matters, medical or employment history. It includes statements made by or
  attributed to the individual. (Civ. Code §1798.3(a)).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>“Electronically Collected Personal Information”</strong> means any
  information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an
  individual user, including, but not limited to, the user’s name, social
  security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number,
  education, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any
  network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted
  to a state agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and
  information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business
  capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or
  principals of that business. (Gov’t Code § 11015.5(d)(1)).
</p>

<h2>Collection and Management of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
  CDT adheres to the following principles in relation to the collection and
  management of Personal Information:
</p>

<ol class="m-l-lg">
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT limits the collection of Personal Information to what is relevant and
    necessary to accomplish its lawful purpose, which is enumerated at or prior
    to the time of collection, in a privacy notice included on or with the form
    used to collect Personal Information. For example, CDT may need to know an
    individual’s e-mail address or telephone number to answer the individual’s
    questions or to provide requested assistance.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT does not collect home, business or e-mail addresses, or account
    information from persons who simply browse the CA.gov website. Personal
    Information about individuals is collected through this website only if an
    individual provides such information to CDT voluntarily through e-mail,
    registration forms, or surveys. This Personal Information will be used to
    facilitate a response to the person or to improve the content or navigation
    of the website or provide survey information to users. The Personal
    Information collected in this manner is not subject to requests made
    pursuant to the Public Records Act (Gov. Code, §§ 7920.000 et seq.), and
    site visitors may request to have their electronically collected personal
    information discarded without reuse or distribution (Govt. Code § 11015.5).
    To make this request, use CDT’s contact information listed below.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT uses Google Analytics to help improve the website. Google tracking
    cookies may be used to provide information to Google Analytics to track
    website statistics. Google tracking code used by every website or
    application that employs Google Analytics, stores information that
    identifies device IP addresses, but CDT’s website is anonymizing that
    information and only part of device IP addresses are being used.
    Consequently, no information identifying you or your device is being stored
    at Google via our utilization of Google Analytics implementation. You can
    find out more about Google Analytics anonymized IP addresses by
    <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en"
      >clicking here</a
    >. You can find out more about Google tracking cookies such as the length of
    time the cookies may remain on your device, or how to remove or manage the
    Google tracking cookies by

      >clicking here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    You may choose to provide CDT your Personal Information, as in e-mail
    address with a comment or question. CDT uses the Personal Information to
    improve its service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes CDT
    forwards your e-mail to other State personnel who may be better able to help
    you, and these personnel may be working for a different agency within the
    State. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or, as required
    by law, CDT does not share your e-mail with any other organizations.
    Submission of an email to CDT or CDT personnel, or communication through the
    website does not create any attorney-client or other privileged or
    confidential relationship. Accordingly, do not disclose any information to
    CDT that you wish to remain private or confidential.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    Individuals, who provide Personal Information to CDT, have the right to
    access their Personal Information that is collected and maintained by CDT
    and to request any correction of any inaccuracies or incompleteness to their
    Personal Information. To make this request, use CDT’s contact information
    listed below.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT uses, discloses, or makes available Personal Information only as
    specified and consistent with those purposes enumerated at or before the
    collection of the Personal Information; unless CDT obtains the consent of
    the subject of the Personal Information, or as required or allowed by law.
    The Public Records Act (Gov. Code, §§ 7920.000 et seq.) exists to ensure
    that California government is open, and that the public has a right to have
    access to appropriate records and information possessed by many state and
    local government agencies. At the same time, there are exceptions that
    recognize the public’s right to access records. These exceptions serve
    various needs, including maintaining the privacy of individuals. In the
    event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Public Records Act
    (Gov. Code, §§ 7920.000 et seq.), the Information Practices Act (CA Civil
    Code, §§ section 1798 et seq.) or other law governing the disclosure of
    records, the applicable law will control.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT collects Personal Information directly from individuals who volunteer to
    use some of our services. The collection of Personal Information may be
    required to deliver specific services, but the use of these services is
    voluntary.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT has taken several steps to protect your Personal Information against
    loss, unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure. CDT, as
    developer and manager of this website, has taken several steps to safeguard
    the integrity of its telecommunications and computing infrastructure,
    including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing. Security
    measures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and
    day-to-day practices of the entire state operating environment as part of
    its continuing commitment to risk management. This information should not be
    construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or
    warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided via CDT’s
    supported website. The technical standards governing security are enforced
    by CDT.
  </li>
  <li class="m-b-md">
    CDT will not distribute or sell any “Electronically Collected Personal
    Information” about users to any third party without prior written permission
    from the user except as set forth in Government Code section 11015.5(b).
    Moreover, any distribution of Electronically Collected Personal Information
    will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us. CDT may
    provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory
    information as provided by law, but no Personal Information is sold or
    distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the website.
