        If you are experiencing problems with the CA.gov website, please check
        the following list:
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Browser version</h2>
      <p>
        Update your internet browser to one of the two most recent versions of
        these web browsers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Edge (part of Windows 10)</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
        <li>Google Chrome</li>
        <li>Apple Safari</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Web traffic</h2>
      <p>
        The CA.gov website may be experiencing a lot of traffic. We recommend
        waiting for complete pages to download before you try clicking any of
        the links.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)</h2>
      <p>
        Your ISP may be experiencing a problem. Try to see if you encounter the
        same problem with another site (see Web Traffic above).
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Your modem</h2>
      <p>
        Your modem may be too slow to download our web pages, causing the page
        to timeout before it is completely loaded. You might want to think about
        upgrading it. It could be causing you problems accessing the web in
        general.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Memory</h2>
      <p>
        Though our web pages aren’t overly large, some do include graphical
        elements. It is possible your computer does not have enough memory. In
        that case, you may want to consider additional memory.
