      <h2 class="m-b-0">Air safety</h2>
      <p>Understand air quality and how to protect yourself from toxins.</p>

      <h3>Outdoor air quality</h3>

      <p>
        Check the
        <a href="https://www.aqmd.gov/">air quality index (AQI)</a> from South
        Coast Air Quality Monitoring District.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind that AQI does not include harmful gases. If you smell smoke
        in the air, it may not be safe to breathe. This is especially true if
        there isnâ€™t much wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay indoors as much as possible. If you have to be outside, limit your
        time outside and wear an N95 mask. An N95 will filter some unhealthy
        particles from the air, but not harmful gases. They also do not fit
        children.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learn more about
        <a
          href="http://www.aqmd.gov/home/air-quality/wildfire-health-info-smoke-tips"
          >air quality during a wildfire</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Indoor air quality</h3>

      <p>
        There may be toxins in your home from smoke and ash. Wear a respirator
        and other protection when you return home.
      </p>
      <h2>Water safety</h2>
      <p>
        The fires contaminated some water systems. Find the
        <a
          href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/emp/wildfire_recovery/"
          >latest information on water safety</a
        >
        from your water provider. Check your water bill to find your provider.
        If you&rsquo;re a renter, ask your landlord.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        If your water provider sent a notice, your water may not be safe to use,
        drink, or boil. If you got a notice like that, use bottled water for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="m-t">Drinking</li>
        <li class="m-t">Baby formula</li>
        <li class="m-t">Brushing teeth</li>
        <li class="m-t">Washing dishes</li>
        <li class="m-t">Making ice</li>
        <li class="m-t">Preparing food</li>
        <li class="m-t">Feeding pets</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your water provider lifted the water notice in your area, you can use
        tap water again.
        <a
          href="https://www.ladwp.com/publications/newsletters/articles/guide-flushing-water-pipes"
          >Flush your water pipes</a
        >
        to clear the contaminated water from your home. Keep in mind that home
        water testing kits aren&rsquo;t reliable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, check for
        <a
          href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/eh/water_quality/beach_grades.cfm/"
          >beach water quality advisories</a
        >. Rain can wash toxins from the fires into the ocean.
      </p>
      <h2>Staying safe at home</h2>
      <p>
        Once you get a pass to return home, be aware of toxic materials and ash.
      </p>
      <h3>Clearing hazardous waste</h3>
      <p>
        The EPA is now removing household hazardous waste from burned
        properties. It is toxic and could spark more fires.
      </p>
      <p>
        They remove toxic and explosive materials they can see. This includes
        things like paints, batteries, and propane tanks. This service is
        automatic and there&rsquo;s no cost to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        If you still see hazardous waste after the EPA cleared your home, leave
        it alone. If you hear a popping or hissing noise or see smoke, leave the
        area immediately and call 911.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a worker at a fire cleanup site, find out how to
        <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/wildfire-faq.html"
          >stay safe while you work</a
        >.

        <a

        <a href="https://www.ca.gov/lafires/return-to-your-home-safely/"
          >next cleanup phase</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>Ash, dust, and debris</h3>
      <p>
        Protect yourself from ash, dust, and debris. They may contain toxic and
        cancer-causing chemicals like asbestos, arsenic, and lead. Limit contact
        with these materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some groups are more sensitive to these materials. They should stay away
        from debris and the cleanup. They include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="m-t">People with heart or lung disease (like asthma)</li>
        <li class="m-t">Older adults</li>
        <li class="m-t">Pregnant women</li>
        <li class="m-t">Children</li>
        <li class="m-t">Pets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you can see ash and smell smoke, you need to clean your home. No
        laboratory test can determine if your property is safe.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep ash from spreading by wet mopping. Put debris and ash in a plastic
        trash bag and throw them away with your regular trash. If ash gets on
        your skin, wash with warm water and soap as soon as possible. Stay safe
        by wearing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="m-t">N-100 or P-100 respirator</li>
        <li class="m-t">Rubber gloves</li>
        <li class="m-t">Booties</li>
        <li class="m-t">Long-sleeved shirts</li>
        <li class="m-t">Long pants</li>
        <li class="m-t">Socks and shoes</li>
        <li class="m-t">Safety goggles (not glasses)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        N95 masks cannot protect you from asbestos. Learn more about the
        <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/fire_resp_protection.html"
