    <h1>Typography</h1>

      type, which includes selecting typefaces, arranging typefaces, and
      organizing them in a visually pleasing and effective manner. It involves

    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Typography encompasses various elements such as typefaces, fonts, point
      sizes, line spacing, letter spacing, and alignment. These elements are
      used to create hierarchy, readability, and aesthetic appeal in written
      communication. Typography plays a crucial role in enhancing the
      readability and legibility of text, conveying meaning and tone, and
      evoking emotions.
    </p>
    <h3>Typefaces</h3>
    <p>
      Typefaces, also known as fonts, are designed sets of characters with
      consistent visual characteristics. They can range from traditional serif
      typefaces to more modern sans-serif or decorative typefaces. Each typeface
      has its own personality and conveys a different mood or message. Typeface
      selection is an important aspect of typography as it helps establish the
      overall tone and visual style of the text.

      Typography is utilized in various mediums such as books, magazines,
      newspapers, posters, websites, advertisements, user interfaces, and more.
      It involves careful consideration of factors like readability, legibility,
      alignment, spacing, and contrast to ensure that the text is clear,
      engaging, and visually appealing to the intended audience.

  <h4>Blockquote</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it.
      He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean
      surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur
      Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted.
